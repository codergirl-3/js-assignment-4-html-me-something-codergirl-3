      <p class="funParagraph" id="testP">I want you to close your eyes and imagine the following items. Now, I understand you cannot literally close your eyes, because you 
         are reading, so I would like you to figuratively close your eyes. 
         Are they (figuratively) closed? Good.</p>
         
      <p>
         <b>The first thing I’d like for you to imagine</b> is a tiny still-life painting. It could be in whatever style you’d like – modern cubic, 
         post-modern abstract, or the standard still life. You can even imagine whatever fruit and bowl you please. Now, I’d like you to imagine
         the painting hanging on an open wall in your home. This is a picture that you want all your friends and family to admire, so make sure
         it’s somewhere that makes a statement. Do you have that beautiful image hanging on your biggest and most public wall? Good. </br>
         </br>
        <b>Now, the next item I’d like for you to imagine</b> is a tiny meal – specifically one of your favorite meals. To be completely clear, when I 
         say tiny meal, I’m not referring to a steak that you pay top &#8364; for only to get 2oz., I’m talking about a tiny meal for a person 
         the size of Stuart Little. If you still can’t imagine what type of meal I’m referring to, then

         don’t know who Stuart Little is, <a href="https://stuartlittle.fandom.com/wiki/Stuart_Little_(character)" target="_blank">click here to meet Stuart</a>.</br>
         </br>
         This was just an imagination warm up, so I’ve kept our scenarios to just two. To review our exercise, I’d like you to <b>reflect on 
         the feeling you had</b> while imagining these tiny items in your full-sized life. Did you experience a warm feeling? Do you now yearn 
         for more tiny things within your life? Do you want to completely flip your life over and go full tiny?</br>
         </br>
         Well, it’s possible! Again, to clarify: This isn’t a ‘Honey I Shrunk the Kids’ situation. While, we don’t currently have that 
         technology at a consumer level what we do have are Tiny Homes! Please keep reading to learn more about the amazing life of 
         living tiny.</br>
         </br>
         Oh and if you haven’t already, please figuratively re-open your eyes.
      </p>
